A list of the "rules" that I have been applying as **my way to live** for the past ~3 years and will continue doing.

* Stress + Rest = Growth.
* Focus on the process, not results.
* Stay humble.
* Build your tribe.
* Take small, consistent steps.
* Be a minimalist to be a maximalist.
* Make the hard things easier.
* Experience Joy.
* Judge people by their questions rather than their answers.

I revisit these "rules" every year, and have found that in the past 2 revisions I haven't added or removed anything from this list.
