I saw this on [Matt Birchler's blog](https://birchtree.me/blog/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023/), and then saw on
Mastodon a multitude of people posting about their default apps in their own blogs. So I decided to jump on the trend,
since it looks like this would be a fun one to do 😅.

Most of my choices are oriented on trying out the private first focused products; I've been through my phase of trying a
specific app for everything, but nowadays, I'm settling down on things that actually work and don't sell my data to others.
