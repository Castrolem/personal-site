I"ß<p>Over the past 6 years of practicing different types of programming, I have worked in different environments, traditional and non traditional, with people that are organized and sometimes not so much, but in the last 2+ years being remote and also part of a big team with great people that love to pair-program, has made me realize that thereâ€™s one particular style that just rocks and thatâ€™s pair-programming, let me tell you why you will think the same.
What isÂ it?</p>
