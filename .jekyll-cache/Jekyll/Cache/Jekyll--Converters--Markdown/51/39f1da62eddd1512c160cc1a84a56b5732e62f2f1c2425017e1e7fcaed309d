<p>Not to long ago Sublime Text 2 was the best editor for me, because it had everything I needed and introduced a little bit of features that were a plus to use from time to time, the packages in sublime are great but this editor is failing behind of the fresh competition for one reason, an endless amount of time spent in their 3rd version which has been on beta for 2 years by now.</p>
