I"Q<p>Luck, it’s a word that sometimes defines a lot in peoples life, I have been very lucky to have the opportunity of do what I love, which is create different web applications from anywhere in the world. All that I need is my laptop, an internet connection faster than 4MBps and lots of beverages/food and for that I’m grateful.</p>
