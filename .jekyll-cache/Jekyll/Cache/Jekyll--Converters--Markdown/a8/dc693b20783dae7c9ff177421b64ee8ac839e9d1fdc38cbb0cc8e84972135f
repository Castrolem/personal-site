<p>Not to long ago Sublime Text 2 was the best editor for me, because it had everything I needed and introduced a little bit of features that were a plus to use from time to time, the packages in sublime are great but this editor is failing behind of the fresh competition for one reason, an endless amount of time spent in their 3rd version which has been on beta for 2 years by now.</p>

<p>It seems like crazy to have a product on beta for so long, and a closed beta in fact. Most of the people doesn‚Äôt know what this third version brings to the table, since it looks the same, works the same and performs the same as V2.</p>

<p>I guess that‚Äôs why the people at Github felt the need to create a new editor, one that satisfy their needs and the needs of lots of others that work in the same branch. We make web apps for our clients, this is a ‚Äúit was time to make our on editor‚Äù kinda thing.</p>

<p>They called ‚ÄúAtom‚Äù and it‚Äôs a perfect name, Atom is just a base layer to the packages that the community driven Github will make for it. In its core, it‚Äôs composed of JS, it‚Äôs integrated with GIT (No one saw that coming right?).</p>

<p>Currently in available for free and hopefully it will stay that way, we don‚Äôt know how successful it‚Äôs going to be yet, what we know is that we‚Äôre going to be in the front line to get it. After several days using it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm discovering things that I didn‚Äôt knew I wanted on a code editor.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-love-it">Why i love it?</h2>
<p>Atom is a web-based desktop application built on top of NodeJS. This allows developers of the ‚Äúlittle things‚Äù to use Node/NPM and browser APIs all in one fluid motion. So in short, being web and node based, it‚Äôs going to be easier for developers to write plugins for it and extend its core than for other editors. This of course means more features will come for you and me.</p>

<p>The command palette its almost the same as Sublime Text 2, which was my default editor by choice for any development, you can clearly see where the inspiration from Atom came when you take a look at the commands that you use here and even the package manager resembles the one on Sublime Text with an enhancement on design of course.</p>

<p>The file switcher, Again, just like Sublime Text‚Äôs amazing quick file switch and search, Atom has implemented almost identical functionality. Atom‚Äôs keyboard shortcut for this is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmd+t</code>, but Sublime‚Äôs keyboard shortcut also works for it: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmd+p</code>. You also can instead just do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmd+b</code> to search only open files.</p>

<p>Atom CLI Tool, with it you can open any file or folder with Atom by just typing the following command in your terminal atom <foldername>.</foldername></p>

<p>A markdown live preview tool, this is great, in the past are the days where you wrote markdown and waited to see it in another program or web app to know how it looks.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-be-better">What could be better?</h2>
<p>Performance it‚Äôs just not there when you add multiple plugins, it really slows down things after just 4-5 and that‚Äôs why it won‚Äôt be the best editor for me until they fix that, but remember it has lots of people contributing to the repository, so there are lots of features and improvements being done as we speak and this project has the upper hand because of it.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great application. With GitHub backing it, I could definitely see it taking off more than what it has. I also see the possibility of an <strong>Atom Marketplace</strong> in our near future with paid packages, I hope they go this route to get founds for the development of future versions, this way they could get more dedicated people to the project.</p>
