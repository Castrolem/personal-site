Getting code to production for the company you work for feels amazing, it gives you this sense of accomplishment, and some sort of adrenaline rush makes you want to do more, but making something yourself from scratch where you are the sole responsible for it. It's a whole new experience.

Now you are not just responsible for the code quality and that the app works, you are also responsible for the community starts to grow over your app, your ideas are being used by an individual, and those ideas will make a dent on their life.

My first app feels like a big responsibility and feels like it made me be better at my job, because it made me understand the work from others in my organization and how much more important they are than what I thought they were.
