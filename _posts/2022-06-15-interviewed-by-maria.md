title:  "I was interviewed by a YouTuber"

I was the guest on the #1 episode of the new series of [Agile State of Mind channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AgileStateofMind),

We spoke about deconstructing the Engineering Managers' Role, a bit about breaking the rules, soft skills, collaboration on
tech specs, and fresh air on what it means to be a real full-stack developer.

Grab your popcorn and put your Engineering lead hat. This was extremely fun to do, and it was really nice to be on the
other side of the show (being the one being interviewed heh).
