title:  "That ☕️ talk you are not taking"
---

I have had the opportunity of grabbing a coffee with many colleagues, my latest one was with [@sospedra_r](https://twitter.com/sospedra_r), we used to work together, then we both quit from our previous company, and we didn't... And now we are working together again. And that's not my point.

My point is that taking a coffee talk with a friend, a colleague or someone that inspires you can take a profound influence on your work and daily life. You probably have been saying to someone "hey, let's grab a cup of coffee when we have time", but you are not making the time to make it happen.

You should. You should give yourself a moment to get inspired, have a nice conversation and discuss whatever is happening over your life, that persons life and live the moment.

After I had my last cup of coffee, I was inspired to renew the search of a new home (yup, I'm making my way through the hurdles of the real estate market in Catalunya) which is something I have been putting on a pause since June 2019. So great things can and will come up from these conversations.
