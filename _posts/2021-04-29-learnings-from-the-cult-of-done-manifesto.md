title:  "Learnings from the cult of done manifesto"
---

Digging through my notes I found an article that spoke
about [the cult of done manifesto](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13) that I have saved a
while ago and thought at that time it was an interesting way of looking at how you make and do things.

I connected with all these ideas and felt like it really represented my way of viewing how I wanted to approach growth
in general. I’m someone that really dislikes procrastinating, but that also have a hard time at relaxing and just
slowing down the pace, so banishing procrastination, in general, was a very interesting moto for me, I started with
following the simple rule of “If you haven’t done anything about it, abandon it and move on to the next thing”.

That mentality has worked great to deliver different side projects lately, to grow my knowledge by reading, doing, and
exploring different areas inside my job and outside of my job knowledge.

But… There’s always one right? It also came with the downside of not only looking to increase my productivity levels at
unhealthy rates. Which I now can acknowledge. This is important not only because it’s health-related, but also because
this is something this manifesto actually tackled, and that’s the “destruction is a variant of done” article, don’t take
it literally of course, but what this actually represents is that you can throw out everything you knew and were doing
to hit a fresh start and continue doing but doing it so better.

Revisiting this article
on [this podcast episode](https://anchor.fm/noessolocodigo/episodes/El-culto-de-hacer-las-cosas-evk1dj)
with [Alexis](https://twitter.com/duranmla) opened some gates for doing a small retro on how I have been doing with my
life mottos and I hope it also does the same for you if you listen to it.

Now, from my reflections, these are **the actions I’m going to take**:

* Start to focus more on experiencing joy than growth.
* Make smaller steps (lately, I have been taking huge leaps), continue being consistent with myself.
* Instead of building one big tribe that can cover multiple topics, build multiple smaller tribes with highly focused
  individuals that I can offer help to, and they can offer me help when needed.
