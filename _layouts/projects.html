				My main focus right now is with <a href="https://cameo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Cameo</a>,
				but
				on
				2020 I decided I wanted to give myself a taste of what the indie developer life looks like, well at
				least a
				bit of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				So I made the decision to dedicate my spare time to the projects & ideas that could make my life in a
				way
				easier.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here are some of the other projects I've worked on in the past — some still actively maintained, and
				others
				on
				pause for now.

			I created this app with the help and designs of <a href="https://twitter.com/schulertime" rel="nofollow"
															   target="_blank">@schulertime</a>, our main focus was to
			provide a way for pet owners
			to track the happiness of their pets, and the best way for it in our opinion is to understand how many
			treats as
			a pet owner you give them.
