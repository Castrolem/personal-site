		I’m a <strong>Full-stack developer</strong>, currently working
		from <strong>Barcelona, Spain</strong>. Making products that work fast,
		are easy to use, persuasive, relevant to the customer and fit in the
		business environment.

		I have also contributed to a couple non-profit organizations like

		I speak <strong>English (Full professional proficiency)</strong> and <strong>Spanish (Native or bilingual

		around the world and meeting new cultures.
