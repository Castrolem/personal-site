          A quick-turnaround, off-the-shelf, affordable service I offer is remote CSS code reviews.
          The review covers things like syntax and formatting, efficiency, architecture, sanity, architectural/scalability
          concerns and a lot, lot more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code review process will follow this steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Review of Designs</li>
          <li>Review of User Interaction patterns</li>
          <li>Review of current HTML/CSS structure</li>
          <li>Write documentation for best practices</li>
          <li>Make suggestions based on findings</li>
          <li>Create a CSS Style-guide with structured examples</li>
          <li>Final document with procedures to follow</li>
          <li>Review with the client after procedures have been implemented</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This service is perfect for projects whose budget typically would not stretch to
          getting me on-site for a number of days, but do require the same type and quality of input.
