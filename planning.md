# Site planning

**Definition:** This is a document that will define the information I will put into the site.

## Colors and visuals

Based on a benchmark that I did to most of other developers site, I figured out that good colors to start with the design are:

* Punch:        `#E2472E` **(red tone)**
* Utah Crimson: `#CE093E` **(red tone)**
* Curious Blue: `#2F97D9` **(blue tone)**
* Summer Sky:   `#3CAEE6` **(blue tone)**
* Tangerine:    `#FFCD00` **(yellow tone)**

## Workflow

Plain and simple, I make great websites like I make my **coffee** :coffee: - strong, reliable and not rushed.

### Research

We will work together on a daily or weekly basis depending on your availability to figure out the key points of your product.

### Planning

Based on the points that we draw together, we'll set deliver dates and objectives for each. For this I like to use a project planning app, if your company or team already use one, we'll use it to make the workflow easier.

### Development

With a beautiful design in place, I will build, test and launch your application. I have experience with different programming languages, my preference is for **Ruby**.

### Support

Don’t worry about software installation, site maintenance and backups. I will set everything for you.
