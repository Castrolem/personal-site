# Luis's Personal Site

Making this site with HTML5, CSS3 and lots of beverages.
:coffee: :wine_glass: :beers:

## Description
I wanted to create a place where I can post a little about me, that was open source so if anyone wanted to help me create a new cool effect for it, improve the code I made or just learn how I like to work using my code could do that.

Also, this site will function as the default URL in all my profile accounts. It will provide a way for potential clients to contact me and find more about my work. Finally, it will be a window to demonstrate the skills I have learned.
